  <h1>About Pycon Poster Section</h1>

<p>PyCon is the premier Python Conference, and in 2014 it is being held for the first very time outside US - in the beautify Montéal/CA. It is not only a great opportunity to met the best python programmers across the world, but also to make the PyCon even better.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p>What about presenting a poster in the Python premier conference?</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>

<p>As a presenter, you get to interact directly with your audience, share your passion and your idea, and immediately address questions in a more conversational manner. Moreover, the environment is generally less stressful and more easygoing than giving a formal talk. On top of that, you met a lot of interesting people.</p>

<p>The idea is to present your topic on a 4'x4' poster board and as attendees mingle through the rows, they find your topic, read through what you have written, the strike up a discussion on it.</p>

<p>Users of all levels go to the poster session, so your topic can focus on novice, intermediate or even expert programmers. Focus on what you think is interesting, rather than difficult/complex. This video will give you an idea of what poster sessions are.</p>

<h2>What kind of proposal can I submit?</h2>

<p>You may be wondering about what kind of python stuff you will be able to talk. As an advice, we can told you that you can talk about anything you want to. Don&rsquo;t be shy.
