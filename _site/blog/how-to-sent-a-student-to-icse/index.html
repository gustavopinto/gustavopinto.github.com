      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        
        <p>This year, an undergraduate student of mine first-authored a paper in the <a href="http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/msr2019c.pdf">MSR
challenge track</a> on the
presence of violations in JavaScript code snippets available on StackOverflow.
This blog post is an attempt to summarize all the steps taken to find a way
to send the student to attend the conference (and present his paper). Perhaps
it could help some other students to make it to ICSE.</p>

<p>Overall, my student applied to four sources of funding: the <a href="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Student-Volunteers">student volunteers</a>, the
<a href="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-Software-Engineering-Mentoring-Workshop">Software Engineering Mentoring Workshop (SMeW)</a>, the <a href="https://www.sigsoft.org/resources/caps.html">CAPS SIGSOFT</a> grant, and an internal grant in my
university. I will detail each one of them next.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the student volunteer program happens every single year in
ICSE (and also happens in several other software engineering conferences, such as
ICSME and ASE). In ICSE, an accepted student volunteer receives a free registration
for the main conference, but could also be scheduled to work in the co-located
events (granting one-two more registration days). Therefore, applying for student
volunteer greatly reduces one of the most costly part of attending a conference:
the conference registration. Besides of it, students volunteers also have an unique
opportunity to meet senior researchers that run the student volunteer program,
and also other students (which could ended up in new research opportunities).
I myself participated as a student volunteer in three conferences (2 OOPSLAs and
one ICSE); I could not recommend more.</p>

<p>Moreover, this year there is the Software Engineering Mentoring Workshop. This
workshop is intended to “attract students to research careers in software engineering”.
I believe this was the first time that this workshop happened in ICSE, although
similar workshops happen on regular basis on programming language conferences
(e.g. <a href="https://pldi19.sigplan.org/home/PLMW-PLDI-2019">PLMW</a>). My student applied
for this grant and received CAD 500,00 plus one day ICSE registration. But since
he received a free ICSE registration for his work as a student volunteer, this
one day registration was not used. Now he had enough for registration and hotel.</p>

<p>Since he had a MSR paper, and was accepted for the mentoring workshop, he applied
for the CAPS funding. CAPS offer support for students and professionals that need
additional funding to attend SIGSOFT conferences. I have applied to this grant in
the past, but since I had received no response for my application, I thought that
this grant was not working. But I suggest my student to apply to it nevertheless.
I also discussed this matter on twitter (read thread <a href="https://twitter.com/gustavopinto/status/1104505538732351490">here</a>), and Thomas Zimmermann, SIGSOFT Chair, responded that he would take care of the
CAPS program. Turns our that my student received USD 400,00 from CAPS (about 50%
of what he asked for). Although this amount does not fully cover a round trip
ticket from Belém to Montreal, it amortizes a good proportion of it.</p>

<p>Finally, I applied for him in an internal travel grant that my university runs
for undergraduate students. The amount was fixed in around USD 330. Although
this is a very particular grant from my university, I am aware that other
Brazilian universities provide similar mechanism to help students. Now his trip
is fully covered (including eventual meals, ground transportation, travel
insurance, etc).</p>

<p>Wrapping up, I am glad that there are many international grants aimed to
help students to attend software engineering conferences. But the trick thing is:
if one of these grants does not have a positive outcome, I would have to complement
his trip out of my own pocket (although I have a small grant running, I could not
use this grant to support his trip; I will leave this explanation for another blog post).
If his application was not accepted in two or more grants, his trip would become
extremely prohibitive. Still, these grants have different application dates
(and, consequently, notification dates). So eventually the student find himself in a
position such as: (1) what if I accept this grant but did not receive the other one?
(2) Could I say “yes” for a grant but eventually say “no” to it due to the lack of
additional support? (3) should I start making reservations, or should I leave it
to the last minute (when tickets often become more expensive)?
These questions are all valid and tough.</p>

<p>Turn out that the stars in the sky were well aligned the applications were all
positive. Reflection upon this endeavour, maybe it would be interesting if all
these programs would have close notification dates to each other.</p>

<p>Final tip: the <a href="https://2019.icse-conferences.org/track/icse-2019-ACM-Student-Research#Call-for-Contributions">ACM Student Research Competition</a> also rewards the students with accepted papers
with up to USD 500,00 to help them defray their travel costs. My student did not
submit to ACM SRC (I may have forgotten; this blog post can help even myself in
the future).</p>
