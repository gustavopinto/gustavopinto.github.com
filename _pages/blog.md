I write mostly about academic life. <br />

**Important note**: For some reason, starting from 2021 I decided to post exclusively on Medium (link [here](https://medium.com/@gustavopinto)).

**Important note 2**: these posts might have typos or weird wording. Although I might be aware of some of these issues, I do not plan to fix any of them. This is because writing takes time. If I want my blog posts to be free of typos, I might ended up not publishing anything, because I may need to polish them a lot (since I'm not a native English speaker, this takes even more time). So many of these blog posts are not polished.<br />
