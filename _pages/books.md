I've published two short e-books.

The [first one](/books/good-research-habits/) is a short book describing some good habits that I think are valuable for young researchers trying to find their way in academia. [For the first 90 days, I donated 100% of the sales to a hospital.](/books/good-research-habits/).

The [second book](/books/open-source-licensing-101/) aims to ease the understanding of open source software licenses. If open source is your thing, you may want to know more about open source licensing.
