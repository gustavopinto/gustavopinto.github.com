Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an **Assistant Professor** at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Par√°](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil, and **Head of Research** at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/). 

I do a lot of writting. I am a [well-published author](/publications), I [blog](https://gustavopinto.medium.com/), I write weekly for my [ML4SE newsletter](https://ml4se.substack.com/) (in PT-BR), and I also self-published two short [e-books](/books). I am also active user on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gustavopinto/) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghlp/). I welcome emails at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.

## Research

I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including refactoring (*e.g.*, [JSS'2019](http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss2019b.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf)), and open source software (*e.g.*, [ICSE-SEET'2019](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse-seet2019.pdf)).

You can see my list of [publications here](/publications), along with ***all*** preprints. I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).


### Practice

As a seasoned developer with expertise in Java, Python, and Ruby technologies, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to every project I work on. I am also well familiar with the  ML/DL domain, using and fine-tuning pretrained large models.

### Minibio

I'm an Assistant Professor at UFPA, Brazil and Head of Research at Zup Innovation, Brazil. I received my Ph.D. from [Federal University of Pernambuco](http://cin.ufpe.br) in 20115. I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including software design, empirical software engineering, and mining software repositories techniques.
