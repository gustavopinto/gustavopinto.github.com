Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an **Assistant Professor** at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil, and a **Research Engineer** at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/). 

I do a lot of writing. I am a [well-published author](/scholarship/), I write regularly for my [ML4SE newsletter](https://ml4se.substack.com/) (in PT-BR), and I eventually [blog](https://gustavopinto.medium.com/). I also self-published two short [e-books](/books). I offer [training and consulting](/consulting/) on LLMs for software engineering (bootcamps and mentorship). I used to be an active user on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gustavopinto/) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghlp/). I welcome emails at mail<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@gustavopinto.org.

### Research & Development

Since 2021, I have been working at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/), where I conduct research & development initiatives to improve the software development process and tools. This move also reflected my research agenda. Recently, my current research focuses on machine learning and language models to improve software engineering tasks. 

In the past, I had broader interests, including refactoring (*e.g.*, [JSS'2019](http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss2019b.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf)), and open source software (*e.g.*, [ICSE-SEET'2019](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse-seet2019.pdf)).

You can see my list of [publications here](/scholarship/), along with ***all*** preprints. I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).
