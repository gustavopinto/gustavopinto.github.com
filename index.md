Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an Assistant Professor at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil, and the Head of Research at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/). I am also the (co-)Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Software Engineering Research and Development ([JSERD](https://sol.sbc.org.br/journals/index.php/jserd/)).

I (eventually) [blog](http://gustavopinto.org/blog/), do [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/gustavopinto), and [videos](http://gustavopinto.org/vlogs/). I am also active on [twitter](http://twitter.com/gustavopinto/). I've published two short [e-books](/books).

<!--

From December 2015 to March 2017 I have been an Assistant Professor at the [Federal Institute of Education, Science, and Technology of Pará](http://www.ifpa.edu.br/), Brazil. Before becoming a professor, I did a Post Doc also with [Dr. Fernando Castor](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/castor).-->

I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including refactoring (*e.g.*, [JSS'2019](http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss2019b.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf)), and open source software (*e.g.*, [ICSE-SEET'2019](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse-seet2019.pdf)).

You can see my list of [publications here](/publications), along with ***all*** preprints. I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).

Are you a [student looking for an advisor](/students)? Are you a researcher and think that our interests overlap? I'm always looking for collaborations; you can reach me at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.


### Mini-bio

I'm an assistant professor at UFPA, Brazil and the head of research at Zup Innovation, Brazil. In 2015, I received my Ph.D. from [Federal University of Pernambuco](http://cin.ufpe.br), Brazil. I have very broad interests in Software Engineering, including Open Source Software (communities and contributors), Human Aspects of Software Engineering, Empirical Software Engineering, and Mining Software Repositories techniques.
