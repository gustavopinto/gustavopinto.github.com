Hi, I'm **Gustavo Pinto**.

I'm an **Assistant Professor** at the [Faculty of Computing](http://www.computacao.ufpa.br/) of the [Federal University of Pará](http://www.ufpa.br/), Brazil, and **Head of Research** at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/). 

I do a lot of writting. I am a [well-published author](/publications), I write weekly for my [ML4SE newsletter](https://ml4se.substack.com/) (in PT-BR), and I eventually [blog](https://gustavopinto.medium.com/). I also self-published two short [e-books](/books). I am also active user on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/gustavopinto/) and on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghlp/). I welcome emails at gpinto<span style="display:none">ignorethis</span>@ufpa.br.

### Research & Development

Since 2021, I have been working at [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/), where I conduct research & development initiatives to improve the software development process and tools. This change have also reflected my research agenda. 

Recently, my current research focuses on machine learning techniques to improve software engineering tasks. In the past, I had broader interests, including refactoring (*e.g.*, [JSS'2019](http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/jss2019b.pdf)), human aspects of software development (*e.g.*, [ICSE'2018](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse2018.pdf)), and open source software (*e.g.*, [ICSE-SEET'2019](http://gustavopinto.github.io/lost+found/icse-seet2019.pdf)).

You can see my list of [publications here](/publications), along with ***all*** preprints. I also maintain my [cv of failure](/cv-of-failures).
